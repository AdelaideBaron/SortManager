# SortManager ðŸ”‚

## Purpose
A sorting manager using the MVC design pattern to generate a random array of integers and sort them using your chosen sorting algorithm. 

## How it works
1. From the app, you will be asked for the length of array, max value in the array, and the algorithm you'd like to use. 

2. A random array is generated in line with the constraints set by the user. The selected algorithm is then used to sort this. 

3. The output consists of the unsorted array, sorted array, the algorithm used, and the time taken. 

4. WIP ðŸš§ - You are then asked if you would like to re-run the program, or leave. 


### Bubble Sort
Iterates through an array comparing adjacent values. 

### Binary Tree
Using a binary tree, we sort the integers in the array using nodes and left/right child. 

### Merge Sort
Divides the array into halves, sosrts, and then merges them at the end.
